# YaPa
Yet another Pomodoro app

YaPa is a small project, just to make my teeth on the Cordova framework.

## Setup

This is a [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) project. You need to install Cordova and its dependencies to compile the project.

Once done, clone the source in your local filessystem. In the project directory, add the platforms you need :

	$ cordova platform add browser ubuntu

Then add the required plugins :

	$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-dialogs cordova-plugin-vibration

## Todo

* add some sort of indication when the counter is interrupted
* make the apple become more and more red as the time passes
* manage the workflow
* the configuration screen
